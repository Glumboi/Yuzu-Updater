# Yuzu Updater
Totally legal and legit downloader for Yuzu Early Access.

My updater won't grab from Pineapple anymore so you have to wait on me to manually upload. I would recommend using the Pineapple updater instead.

Thanks to MG for Pineapple and everyone else involved of course. I'm still going to update mine since it's a habit at this point but if you don't want to wait on me then make sure you grab this updater instead.
